Code for the paper "On the metricity of the Chatterjee correlation coefficient". We used Python 3.11.7. After installing the dependencies, compute the Chatterjee distances for all pairs of random variables using:
```bash
python3 experiments.py
```
Then, to obtain the plots, run:
```bash
python3 check_ti.py
```
Specifically, the three plots in the paper are: max_viol_undirect_triples_all.pdf, viol_distr_direct_triples.pdf, and viol_distr_undirect_triples.pdf.
